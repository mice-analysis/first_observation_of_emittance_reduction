Note also that the downstream efficiency (TKD, TOF2) is much more important than 
the upstream efficiency; it may not make sense to make the distinction yet.

\subsection{Tracker}

Description of tracker and reconstruction (few words but mostly citation).

Proof that the field is understood within tracker region - Hall probes.

Proof that the resolution is understood - Kalman pulls and chi2. 

Proof that the efficiency is understood (and good); probably something like 
number of 5 point, 4 point tracks and demonstration that this is consistent with
expected noise/dead channels? Look at straight tracks data?

\subsection{TOF}

Description of the TOFs and reconstruction (few words but mostly citation).

Proof that the resolution is understood - e.g. plane 0 vs plane 1 for each TOF station.

Proof that the efficiency is understood - e.g. number of plane 0 hits vs number 
of plane 1 hits for each TOF station.

\section{Other detectors}

Do we want to pull the other detectors in?
