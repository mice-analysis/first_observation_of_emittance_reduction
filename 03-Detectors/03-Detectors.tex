\section{Detectors}
\label{Sect:Detectors}

In this section, the resolution and efficiency of the detector systems is
discussed. The reconstruction is validated both internally within each
detector system, using the detector's internal redundancy, and by extrapolating
reconstructed events between detectors.

\subsection{Tracker}

\textbf{Author: Chris Hunt}

Description of tracker and reconstruction (few words but mostly citation).

Proof that the field is understood within tracker region - Hall probes.

Proof that the resolution is understood - Kalman pulls and chi2. 

Proof that the efficiency is understood (and good); probably something like 
number of 5 point, 4 point tracks and demonstration that this is consistent with
expected noise/dead channels? Look at straight tracks data?

\subsection{TOF}

Description of the TOFs and reconstruction (few words but mostly citation).

Proof that the resolution is understood - e.g. plane 0 vs plane 1 for each TOF station.

Proof that the efficiency is understood - e.g. number of plane 0 hits vs number 
of plane 1 hits for each TOF station.

\section{Other detectors}

Do we want to pull the other detectors in?
