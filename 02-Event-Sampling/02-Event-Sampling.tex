\section{Event Sampling}
\label{Sect:EventSampling}

\bf{Author: Chris Rogers}

Here we describe how we selected a sample of events. E.g. PID cuts, momentum
cuts, various good event cuts.

Nb: We have to discuss the cuts first because we need to exclude non-muon events
from the plots, especially data quality type plots. Somehow there is a logical 
challenge because we need to explain the cuts before we have proved that the 
detectors (etc) work, so we have to invite the reader to believe that our 
detectors work and prove it in the next section...

May decide to go "lite" here, push this into section 01 and push more into section 05.
