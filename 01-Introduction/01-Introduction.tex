\emph{Strategy - the aim of the paper is to show that MICE reduces normalised 
emittance and this is consistent with MC. In order to demonstrate this, we 
select 2016/04 1.2 and 2016/04 1.5 as the cooling channel settings to use (they 
are likely to have best cooling and 1.5 also supports Ao's IPAC paper). The
analysis is intended to be a `minimal' analysis, i.e. we get just enough to
prove emittance reduction. We don't have to do all the fancy analyses yet, but 
we do have to be correct and rigorous.}
