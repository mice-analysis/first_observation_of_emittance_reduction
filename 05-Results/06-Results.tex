\section{Results}

Describe the results.

\subsection{Optics}

Demonstrate that the optics is consistent with expectation i.e. projected beam
upstream looks like measured beam downstream (beta functions?)

\subsection{Amplitude Distribution}

The change in number of events upstream and downstream of the absorber is shown 
in \ref{fig:amplitude_distribution} for empty and full configurations.


Show amplitude distribution upstream vs amplitude downstream.
