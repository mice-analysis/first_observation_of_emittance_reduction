\section{Results}

\bf{Author Rogers}

Describe the results.

\subsection{Optics}

Demonstrate that the optics is consistent with expectation i.e. projected beam
upstream looks like measured beam downstream (beta functions?)

\subsection{Emittance}

Demonstrate that the emittance is consistent with expectation.

Show amplitude distribution upstream vs amplitude downstream.
