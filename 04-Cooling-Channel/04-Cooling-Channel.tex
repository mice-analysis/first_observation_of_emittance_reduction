\subsection{Magnets}

Demonstrate stability of magnets over the operational period of the experiment -
archiver and hall probes.

Demonstrate that we understand the magnetic channel; extrapolate tracks and 
show that they join up.

\subsection{Absorbers}

Demonstrate that we understand the absorbers? Show that mean, RMS of extrapolated 
tracks is consistent with models for energy loss/straggling and MCS.
