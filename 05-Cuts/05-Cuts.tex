\section{Cuts}

\textbf{Author Rogers}

Describe the sampling.

\subsection{Good TOF0/TOF1 Cut}

Reject events that don't get a clean signal in TOF0 and TOF1

\subsection{Good TKU Cut}

Reject events that don't get a clean signal in TKU.

\subsection{Aperture Upstream Cut}

Reject muons going through upstream apertures (e.g. diffuser)

\subsection{PID Cut}

Reject muons based on TOF01 vs tracker. Show that this is consistent with PID
cuts in other detectors. May need a whole section to discuss PID (e.g. 
do we want to go into Ckov, EMR, "global PID"?), depending on how things go.

\subsection{TKU momentum cut}

Reject muons based on TKU momentum; this is to reduce chromatic aberration.

\subsection{Aperture cut}

Depending on what plots go into the "Results" section, we may want to make an
aperture cut based on projected TKU tracks.
